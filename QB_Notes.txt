QB_Notes

QBInterface is a super class for QBHand and QBCube. 

QB_Interface_Node:

QB_Class initializes and activates the 6 cubes and the 1 hand, however, by itself does not launch any controllers. 

qb_interaction listens to values written to topics on /qb_control/robot_ref (using rqt reconfigure) and "sends it" to the cubes. 

qb_control.cpp

listens to /qb_control/robot_pose_ref - referenceCallback


qb_control.cpp has a spin() which is always running. This is the block of code which implemnts the FFDC, PID etc....This block of code constantly monitors the qref and qref_RL and makes sure that the current position matches the reference. 

qb_controller_manager uses ROS's controller interface to build a wrapper around the qb_control class. The read() and write() function in qb_controller_manager essentially uses the get and set services from the qb_control class respectively.
